        <h2>IS THIS WHAT WAS MEANT</h2>
        <P>
            Civil war? Is that what you said? <br>
My heart tells me differently, as they all lay there dead <br>
I wonder if killing of men is at all civil <br>
The aching of seeing running blood hurts, even belittles <br>
<br>
I pulled the trigger, but I don't know why <br>
Their eyes roll back in their heads, my heart cries <br>
I hear orders being shouted to keep shooting them down <br>
One by one, they each slowly fall crumpling to the ground <br>
<br>
The dirt around me is no longer brown in color, but soaked in red <br>
Men, women, and children, my dear God so many lay in pieces dead <br>
I do this for my country and its freedom, that is what I am told <br>
Why dear Lord, don't I feel brave, don't I feel bold <br>
<br>
A horrible cringing of sadness inside is all that I feel <br>
How can I keep pulling this trigger? It can't be real <br>
Limbs spread laying aimlessly out all over the ground <br>
Shot up bloody bodies and pieces, and the screaming abound <br>
<br>
Flying and explosions of flashing lights as grenades explode <br>
The ground is shaking under my feet with each deadly blow <br>
Dear God, is this what my country continues to call me to do <br>
Dismembering humans is what I am ordered by you <br>
<br>
The war is over now, and I return home <br>
Shame on my face, my self-esteem completely blown <br>
I thought my country would be proud that I served <br>
As I disembark the plane, I am cold, chilled, unnerved  <br>
<br>
I wasn't a hero, I wasn't their knight in white armor <br>
It felt like I was so alone, not being an historical war charmer <br>
How could my country after what they asked see me in this light <br>
Shame dripping from me, I was a mess, a horrible sight <br>
<br>
Dear God, how could my country find shame in me <br>
I did what they ordered, by pulling the trigger you see <br>
Is this what my keeping peace and freedom meant to them <br>
I wonder how many of us feels this, of those that were sent <br>
<br>
I only know even today that I still feel forgotten and lost <br>
Remembering again, the lives, and deaths, this has cost <br>
But for the security of freedom in my country I would do it again <br>
For its peace on earth, and our freedom, right up to the end <br>
<br>
I will answer the call should the need arise one more time <br>
Defending my country as I did in the past, with love and  American pride <br>
Only this time I will make sure that the cause is worthwhile <br>
As I once again view bodies falling, those of men, women and someone's child <br>
<br>
You have to know that this calling is part of my pride in American freedom <br>
When they call upon all soldiers, we know we must heed them <br>
But part of me fears the rebirth of that vision I now have inside <br>
For I shed salt laden tears and humble in my American pride <br>
<br>
Sparkling in Gold, <br>
