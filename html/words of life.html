        <h2>WRITE ME THE WORDS OF LIFE</h2>
        <p>
                        
            Write to me the words of your heart <br>
            Telling me how were growing, although miles apart <br>
            Calling me nightly, as we enjoy the exchanges of voices <br>
            Your making all the right moves, your deciding the choices <br>
            <br>
            Write with a pen in your hand and a small piece of paper <br>
            The parts of your being, for my eyes to read and to savor <br>
            Share with me dreams, and your hearts tiny love spaces <br>
            Tell of your new shoes, and their sturdy white laces <br>
            <br>
            Speak of the job where you spend each long day <br>
            Telling me how you do this for a living and for pay <br>
            Exchange with me the ways of your mind <br>
            Licking the envelope and addressing it to be mine <br>
            <br>
            Folding the corners so nice and neat <br>
            Creasing the center, with a loving touched pleat <br>
            Finding a way to open it with such care <br>
            Adjusting my clothes and sweeping my eyes clear of my hair <br>
            <br>
            Slicing it open, and unfolding the words inside <br>
            Exposing what you've written, from you hearts loving eye <br>
            Holding the unsealed letter in my hand upon my breast <br>
            Seeing the "I love you", are the only words I viewed, leaving behind the rest <br>
            <br>
            Sparkling in Gold... <br>
            Sparkie
