        <h2>UNPLANNED LONGINGS</h2>
        <P>
        
You left, you said you never would! <br>
How come you did? <br>
You said you needed me, <br> 
Didn't you mean it? <br>
<br>

When we touched, it was that of a lifetime, <br>
I am longing for it again, why? <br>
Did you know that love does hurt? <br>
Is this what you wanted me to feel? <br>
<br>

I protected you, and kept you warm with my ways, <br>
Perhaps the chilling truth was, that it wasn't warm enough! <br>
Planning to love is not what happens, <br>
Falling in love, that is what occurred! <br>
<br>

You love me, me loving you; <br>
This was our plan, that was our pledge and promise! <br>
Now it just desires and aching for those planned longings!! <br>
<br>

Sparkling in Gold... <br>
