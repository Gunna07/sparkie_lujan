            <p>I am an educated, honest, 55 yr. old single lady, retired as a CEO/Pres/Founder of an International Non Profit Foundation. I am faith based, and happy. I live on the Gallatin River, which flows out of Yellowstone Park, in Montana. This is my tranquility and joy! I love anything to do with the outdoors.I have been a writer since the age of fifteen. I am published, and some of my work resides in the White House, in Washington, D.C. I don't have any pets at this time, but have had many animals over the course of my life. I have three grown children, and three beautiful grandkids. Life is great, and one day will be even better when my heart finds the right owner. Until then, I couldn't ask for anything else in this life to bring me joy and happiness. I have it all!</p>
