        <h2>THE MEADOW</h2>
        <p>
    Back in July, not long ago, I was standing at the entrance of some farmhouse in the country, glaring out
      into this vast meadow. The gates into this meadow were locked. I wanted in. So I climbed over the metal
      railings that only had paint chips of green and white. Rust has taken its chunk out of the original 
      paint job. A huge gray metal lock with a bold chain attached to it, hung there, holding the gates shut.
      My eyes and mind had yearned to cross over this security gate, and walk into the meadow. Wild flowers were in
    bloom, and the tall sweeping grass was flowing in the gently warmed breezes. Trees were scarce except for a
      few, leafless old dead trees, and one huge Weeping Willow, that had more life in it than you would ever
      thought possible. <br>
              <br>
    I continued to stare out into the meadow, wondering how that old willow tree could be so wonderful looking,
    when the other trees were all but splinters, of what use to be glorious life living statues of nature's
     creations. There was a burning, aching in me, that continue to roar, pulling me into this meadow. I knew
      once I climbed over the gates, life would never be the same. I couldn't hold back. Oh god, I wanted to
      feel what was pulling me into this arena of beauty and why. Standing there, leaning against the gates,
     my eyes swept over the meadow one more time. I started with small steps, breathing slowly, and with each
    breath, my heart pounded more intensely. What was this pulling in my soul? How come it was so strong?
    What is causing this aching in me to go on further. <br>
                 <br>
  Huge beads of sweat began to form on my forehead. My arms would swing more rapidly
     as I began to step more quickly into this glorious meadow. My feet were laying their prints,
    changing the earth's soil with each step. The dress I was wearing, although tattered, swayed in
    the gentle breezes. A cooling, evaporating sensation flowed over me, like natures cooling system. 
    So many sensations were flooding my body, filling my mind, trapping me into the unknown. I only
        felt more compelled to continue my journey that was heading me towards this old Weeping
        Willow tree. The trunk was so perfectly shaped; the branches hung their green leaves in military
                       order. Broken branches hung on, clinging with fibers that once bore life into them. 
Sweeping limbs swayed in the wind like a melody ringing out natures tunes, and notes for all 
to listen and rejoice in. The sky was the backdrop for this vision I was ingesting. Dear Lord,
    where are you taking me? I had no control over my body; my actions were guided by something
    I couldn't put words to. Tugging within me was intensifying. Nature was my leader. <br>
    <br>
    Turning around, and seeing where I had come from, the distance more than a mile in reverse seemed
merely minor footprints. I was not tired. Energized was more the feeling I had. This tree, was calling me, 
    and I didn't know why. Huge puffy white clouds were overhead, and the sun beating down onto my back.
    Boulders were only in sight of me when I would lay one foot in front of the other. Tall summer grass came
        up to my knees. Each step felt like a cushioned marshmallow. I could see my feet, one in front of the
        other, only there was no sensation of pressure in them as they touched the earth's surface. Tingling
        sensations in my fingers were so apparent, as though they were sleeping. My arms kept sweeping at my 
        sides, forward and backwards, in perfect timing of my opposite foot. My torn up, worn out shoes showed
        me that I have covered many miles in the last few months, since I had purchased  
        them. Shrugging my shoulders and a small disappointing grin appeared as I began to think about this dress.
     The colors were all but faded. The length rested just below my knees. Yellow little flowers use to sing
      out in the background that was a brilliant white. Now looking at it, the flowers and the background are
     all but one color. I wished sometimes, life would have put me into the wealthy class of folks, but I am
            grateful for what mama and papa did for me as I was growing up. <br>
            <br>
            <br> <br>

            
    Now at the age of twenty-five, I can hardly remember what they looked like. They have been gone since I was
     sixteen, and life since then has been one rocky road after another. My mind continues to flash back as I
      engage further into my walk towards that Willow Tree. Aaahhh...Stewart Baxter. What a fine man he was.
       Although I had known him as my high school sweetheart, it wasn't until later in life, that I really knew
        the man. My heart and soul continue to ache and crave his touch. Finally reaching this Willow Tree, I
         realize it didn't take near as long as I thought it would have. Bending over...and curling one leg under
        me, I sit with great relief. My mind has taken me back to earlier times and more peaceful thoughts.
        Sitting here, I see the beauty of this meadow. The thought crosses my mind wondering if anyone saw 
        me walking here. Trespassing on someone else's land in these parts was not very wise. How could I
        explain to them, the pulling desire to rest under this old tree? I suppose, if the time comes, and
            I have to answer those questions, I will find a way. Stretching out both my legs, and leaning back
            on my hands, I raise my head in an upward motion to the sky. Seeing before me are the blues that
            God has created with natures pallet. Oh, those clouds, how soft and puffy they appear. Birds were 
            chirping off in the distance and natures symphony is surrounding me. <br>
            <br>
     Laying back, flat on the ground, raising my feet so that my knees are bent, I take my dress and tuck it under
      me. Just laying here, closing my eyes, letting my mind wander, seems to keep my thoughts going back to the 
      visions of Stewart. Oh that man, I loved him like no other. His strong frame when he would pull me to him. 
      Wrapping me into his arms was the only time I think I felt totally secure in life. I had no fears, no
       yearnings, no emptiness. Where are you Stewart? Why have you not come home? It's been so many years
        ago, yet I can feel his touch on me. Caressing me, squeezing me to his chest. Dropping soft, moist 
        kisses on my forehead...and running them all over my face I felt so special. His tongue would stretch
         out, wetting my lips with his. How I miss him so! <br>
         <br>
  Opening my eyes, I can follow the clouds moving. Images in the sky, creating creatures, figures, and little
   monsters as I continue to gaze at them. A warm smile appears as a new image is found, and an old disappears.
    Mother nature is so creative. Suddenly, another flash goes through my mind. What if Stewart is yearning for
     me, as I am for him? Could that be possible? Does this craving transcend miles, and years? Why now is this
      yearning so intense in me? Why is this Weeping Willow calling out to me? Talk to me old tree; tell me why
       I am here. I don't know who owns this property, I have never stepped foot here before. Questions in my mind
        begin to race. The answers are not coming quick enough. I sit up...and feel a chill in my body. The warmth
         of the walk is all but a passing sensation. The sweat beads on my brow are gone. Wrapping my arms around
          my knees...I shake out the dirt from my hair. Pulling little sprigs of broken twigs, and tiny pebbles 
          that seem to have weaned themselves into my hair. Tugging them, and throwing them to the side where I 
          sit took but just a few moments. Again, I look across this meadow, and I have no idea what it is that is
           pulling me to stay here. I know I have work to be done. But something, as strange as it sounds, is 
           magnetically holding my body firmly to this tree. <br>
           <br>
           
Turning my head to the tree trunk, I look to see if anyone has carved their name into it. Tracking all of the
 cracks, and weather beaten knots, I see above me a carving. Only from where I sit, I can't make out what it says.
  So I stand up, and squint my eyes, trying to make out the letters. Reaching with my hand to feel the outline is
   hard to do. I stretch up on my tiptoes, and feel the rough bark scratching my arm. I don't seem to notice the 
   pain it must be causing, only a burning desire to make out these letters. My god, what are they? Why am I so
    intent on reaching them? Finally, I can feel one of them. It's an "S". Oh god, what is the other one? Relaxing
     down again on flat feet, I find my breathing is more of a panting. My heart is searing, my chest pounds with
      a horrendous power deep inside. What is happening to me? Why am I doing this? How come I feel this way? My
       mind once again races. Again I reach to the carvings, and feel them under my fingertips. Closing my eyes,
        I'm trying to trace the images and read what they say. I want to know what is under my fingertips.
         Reaching, and stretching to heights, my body is almost unable to touch them. Jumping at times, trying to 
         reach the second letter. It's a "B". It's a "B"! Ok, thinking for a moment, resting my body and the
          burning sensations that my arms and legs are feeling, I ponder at the letters. Lets think, there was 
          an "S" and a "B". Nothing comes to mind. No reason for it to, since I had never been here before. Perhaps
           visions of two love birds sitting here years ago, making their marks in this old Weeping Willow is 
    what was calling to me. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Glancing down at my watch, I can see the day is passing me by quickly. I think about leaving, and all the work that is still
    ahead of me to get done this day. I look in the direction of the gates, only now they are out of my eyes view. Only things I
        see are the tall grass swaying and the wildflowers still sweeping their lovely colors so brilliantly. Once again, I glance up 
        to the tree cravings. I have to feel the rest of it. I have to know what it is that is carved in the tree. Why? What does it mean?
        I am scared inside, fearing the emotions this day has brought unto me. I am generally so stable, only today; something is 
        rocking me into this dreamlike state. Again, I look around. I am trying to find something to stand on that will enable me 
        to reach higher on the trunk. My fingers are itching with a desire to etch out the letters. Nothing is near me. Nothing to
        stand on. Damn! <br> <br>
        How can I do this? I remember stepping over a big boulder on my way here, not so far back from the direction I had come earlier.
        I began to run in the direction of that boulder, but the grass is so tall. Oh God, lead me to that rock. Almost as soon and I 
        thought of this request, there before me, laid the rock. Rolling it over and over again, it finally was resting in position 
        against the trunk of this tree. Between the walk here, and moving this boulder, my body was beginning to slow down. I hadn't 
        brought anything to drink or eat with me, and my body was soon telling me that it was in need nourishment. <br> <br>
        Anticipating the findings on this trunk soon became the foremost thought in my mind. Stepping up on the boulder, it was
        somewhat unstable. So I got off and readjusted it to a more concreted position. Finally with the rock in place, I again
        got on. Now with me standing only inches from the carved initials, I 
        could clearly see the "S" and the "B". There in the center of this design, which was no longer very visible, were the letters
         "M" and "J". Trying to memorize these letters, and retain them, was easy since the "M" and "J" were the same as my initials. So
          now I just had to remember the "S" and "B". Stepping down off the boulder, I was getting ready to head back to the gates, when 
          I saw off in the distance, a person waving at me. I could hear him calling to me, but with the distance so far, I could not make
           out what he was saying. My heart began to sink. I knew if I ran, he might shoot me. If I stayed, I would be charged with trespassing. 
           Oh God, what should I do? The only thing that made sense to me right now was that I was in trouble. Rather than taking a chance 
           at being shot at for trespassing, I slowly began to walk towards this image. After about three minutes, I could distinguish that 
           the figure was that of a rather large sized man. My heart continued to pound, and the sweat once again returned to my brow. <br> <br>
           When this man was about fifty feet from me, I gasped for air. My head began to twirl. Trying desperately to focus on this gentleman,
            a screaming voice in me kept saying over and over again it's Stewart!! It's Stewart! Oh my God, the initials on the tree, Stewart
             Baxter plus Molly Jerkins!!!!! <br> <br>
             The air in my lungs all but dissipated. I found myself in a dream like state once again. Frozen in place, time was standing 
             still. Visions flooded my mind, past memories rushing from locked up files. How can this be? It's not real! Tell me it's not
              real...is what I kept saying. Stewart!!!! It's Stewart. Tears began flowing down my cheeks like hot flaming swords! My body 
              sending shock waves to the top of my head, running all the way to the bottom of my toes. Oh my God, oh dear God, my Stewart. 
              My Stewart! <br> <br>
              
 We both stood there, motionless. Time had us in a capsule. Holding us, freezing us in place. Standing before me was the man I had loved of 
my entire life. Almost touchable, only a few feet apart, and yet his warmth coated me like no one has done before. Wrenching, aching, 
 craving, desiring, were just the beginning of the feelings I now had boiling in me. Our eyes fixed on one another. Words were not spoken.
  Slowly I glanced over to the tree trunk, his eyes following mine. I turned back my eyes into his direction, and there was his familiar smile.
   My heart began to slow, my body began to melt, and I could see the ground coming closer to my eyes. He stretched out his arms....and grabbed
    me. My breathing was so shallow. The once lovely sky, and clouds were spinning out of control. Twirling around and around was all I could 
    see. Finally, I caught sight of his eyes. The spinning stopped. His lips were moving, only I didn't hear the sounds. Then out of the
     lips of the man I had desired and loved for years said, "Molly, I have loved you like no other, I have craved you for so many years." 
     I raised my hand to sweep his face, and brush back his thick blond hair. I groped at the words he had said, and I replied, "Stewart, 
     I have loved you too!". <br> <br> <br>
     On this day, and from then on, Molly and Stewart knew they were finally home in one another arms! Since this wonderful reunion took place,
      I often of wonder if fate really called out to me on this glorious summer day!
