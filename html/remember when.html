        <h2>REMEMBER WHEN</h2>

        <p>
            
Old age, I decided,is a gift. <br>
I am now, probably for the first time in my life, <br>
the person I have always wanted to be. <br>
Oh, not my body! <br>
I sometimes despair over my body ... <br>
the wrinkles, the baggy eyes, and the sagging butt. <br>
<br>
And often I am taken aback by that old person that <br>
lives in my mirror, <br>
but I don't agonize over <br>
those things for long. <br>
<br>

I would never trade my amazing friends, <br>
my wonderful life, <br>
my loving family, <br>
for less grey hair, or a flatter belly. <br>
As I've aged, <br>
I've become more kind to myself, <br>
and less critical of myself. <br>
I've become my own friend. <br>
<br>

I don't chide myself for eating that extra cookie, <br>
or for not making my bed, <br>
or for buying that silly cement gecko that I didn't need, <br>
but looks so avant-garde on my patio. <br>
<br>

I am entitled to overeat, <br>
to be messy, to be extravagant. <br>
I have seen too many dear friends <br>
leave this world too soon; <br>
before they understood the great freedom <br>
that comes with aging. <br>
<br>
Whose business is it if I choose to read <br>
 or play on the computer  <br>
 until 4 a.m. and sleep until noon? <br>
 <br>
I will dance with myself to <br>
those wonderful tunes of the 60's, <br>
 and if I, at the same time, <br>
  wish to weep over a lost love... <br>
I will. <br>
<br>
I will walk the beach in a swim suit <br>
 that is stretched over a bulging body, <br>
and will dive into the waves <br>
 with abandon if I choose to, <br>
despite the pitying glances <br>
from the bikini set. <br>
<br>

They, too, will get old. <br>
I know I am sometimes forgetful. <br>
But there again, some of life <br>
is just as well forgotten. <br>
And I eventually remember the important things. <br>
<br>

Sure, over the years, <br>
my heart has been broken. <br>
How can your heart not break <br>
when you lose a loved one, <br>
or when a child suffers, <br>
or even when a beloved pet <br>
gets hit by a car? <br>
<br>

But broken hearts are what give us strength <br>
and understanding and compassion. <br>
A heart never broken is pristine and sterile <br>
and will never know the joy of being imperfect. <br>
<br>
I am so blessed <br>
to have lived long enough <br>
to have my hair turn grey, <br>
and to have my youthful laughs be <br>
forever etched into deep grooves on my face. <br>
<br>

So many have never laughed, <br>
and so many have died <br>
before their hair could turn silver. <br>
I can say "no", and mean it. <br>
I can say "yes", and mean it. <br>
<br>

As you get older, <br>
it is easier to be positive. <br>
You care less about what other people think. <br>
I don't question myself anymore. <br>
I've even earned the right to be wrong. <br>
<br>

So, to answer your question, <br>
I like being old. <br>
It has set me free. <br>
I like the person I have become. <br>
<br>

I am not going to live forever, <br>
but while I am still here, <br>
I will not waste time lamenting <br>
what could have been, <br>
or worrying about what will be. <br>
But will continue to rejoice in what was. <br>
