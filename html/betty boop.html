        <h2>BETTY BOOP LOVES LITTLE TOOTS</h2>
        <P>

Sending winks out to you, <br>
and small smirking smiles <br>
Come into my clutches my dear, <br>
like a friendly croc-o-dile <br>
<br>

Let me touch you with softly placed pats, <br>
and little love smacks <br> 
Hang your hat over there mister, <br>
on one of the hat and coat racks <br>
<br>
Swaying my body from side to side <br>
Talking sexy to you, on this alluring love ride <br>
My lips are all wet, and my bodies in motion <br>
How about smearing me with some of that hot body lotion? <br>
<br>
Casting my spells, and jarring your world <br>
Oh my my....I am naughty little girl <br>
My dress is so tight, and my hair is all curly <br>
Flinging a feather at you my pet, feeling oh so girlie <br>
<br>
Why do your eyes light up like a man in love <br>
Could it be because I'm wearing this slinky little lace glove? <br>
I'm teasing you with the woman in me <br>
Now come give me a kiss mister....before I flee <br>
<br>
My nylons are silky, my emotions are restless <br> 
Muss up my hair with your body, I couldn't careless <br>
Grabbing me roughly and using the chains <br>
Is not my idea, of a love sharing game <br>
<br>
Swapping of tongues, and letting them fly <br>
Oh my dear, did you just hear me let out a soft little....sigh <br>
Now this is poem for only your laughter <br>
It's that hidden inside my lovely .... <br>
pet, that this lady is after!!!! <br>
<br>
Sparkling in Gold ... <br>
and Smiles Too <br>
Sparkie
