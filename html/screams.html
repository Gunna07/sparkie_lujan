        <h2>SCREAMS</h2>
        <P>
            
Openings in the face of life <br>
Reaching down and pulling out <br> 
Screams of joy and smiles abound <br>
Only inside do I wear this frown <br>
<br>


You see me smiling at you <br>
Accepting what is seen to be fact <br> 
Only I know what lays within  <br>
Only my faith in God is intact <br>
<br>


Faith surrounds those who trust <br>
Smiles in life are an expected must <br>
Tears never show what highways I've traveled <br>
My lips are sealed within my faith  <br>
 <br>

Can this unseen valley of trust be worthy of my silence <br>
I think so as my heart believes in your words <br>
Then I take it upon myself to open my doors widely <br>
I quiver at the thought of unleashed memories <br>
<br>


Free me from this hidden place <br>
Let the screams of joy and love just radiate! <br> <br>


Sparkling in Gold... <br> 
Sparkie
