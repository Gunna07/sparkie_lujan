        <h2>SON, I AM OFF TO WAR</h2>
        <p>
            I speak these words to you this day <br>
            Son, home is where I want to stay <br>
            I fear that I will miss your all of your youth and smiles <br>
            Oh dear Lord, I am going to miss this beautiful child <br>
            <br>
            All the days that pass he will be without a dad <br>
            Why is my soul feeling so empty and sad <br>
            I want to rear this child that is my gift in life <br>
            Aching at the thought of leaving him and my wife  <br>
            <br>
            We have a home, and a garden that's new <br>
            My new born daughter's birth, I will miss that too <br>
            I am going to be ordered to take another human beings life <br>
            Oh Lord son, I know he will most likely have his own wife <br>
            <br>
            God I hate the thought of killing and going to war <br>
            I just want to hide behind my homes wooden front door <br>
            Bravery and valor and fighting is fine for some <br>
            But my heart cries out, I want to raise my son  <br>
            <br>
            Please dear Lord, find peace before I go <br>
            I have tears running down my cheeks, so warm is the flow <br>
            Don't you see my world consists of loving and living <br>
            Filled is my soul with pure thoughts of giving <br>
            <br>
            I am sorry son, I have orders to now leave <br>
            Panic and fear, and lost time with you is what I grieve <br>
            Just know you are always loved by your dad ....son <br>
            As I turn, and walk away from my home, in my hand....a loaded gun <br>
            <br>
            Sparkling in Gold... Sparkie It is with great pride, that I personally say <br>
            THANK YOU to all Soldiers for allowing my own family and the world to live in peace. <br>
            <br>
            Lovingly... <br>
