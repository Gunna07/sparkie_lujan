        <h2>TRIBUTE TO SHARA</h2>
        <p>
            Here Ya Go Sis! <br>
            Because You're My Sister, And I Love You! <br>
            I will give it all I have for you. <br>
            I am standing in your shadow, <br>
            fighting with you, and loving you, <br>
            holding you closer than one could ever imagine. <br>
            I stand with you as life challenges us, <br>
            We will find strength in one another, <br>
            Smiling together is what we will always do, <br>
            <br>
            Why??? <br>
            <br>
            Because you're my sister, and I love you! <br>
            <br>
            As each day unfolds, and shows its color <br>
            I will lift up a prayer for you, and our family <br>
            Together we will endure this pain of ours <br>
            <br>
            We're sisters, we are one and the same! <br>
            <br>
            Never be blinded to lifes riches <br>
            Dwelling in caves of despair isn't our way <br>
            Smiling as the sun rises, and the moon sets <br>
            Bound together simply within our sister love! <br>
            <br>
            Why??? <br>
            <br>
            Because, I love you <br>
            <br>
            Hold me close, and let me be your rock <br>
            Lean on me, as we travel the Cancer road <br>
            Map our days by our inner strength <br>
            Hugging tightly every step of the way! <br>
            <br>
            You will make it my dear sister <br>
            I have faith enough for us both <br>
            Tell me how to help you along the way <br>
            Tightly woven with our sister past and present days! <br>
            <br>
            Why??? <br>
            <br>
            Because I love you, and we are sisters! <br>
            <br>
