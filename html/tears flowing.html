    <h2>TEARS FLOWING WITHIN</h2>

    <P>
 Tears flowing with the warmth, that only frustration could cause <br>
Conveying a message so hard to believe <br>
Trust is what has to be understood <br>
How can I make you believe me <br>
<br>

It's time we lay down more foundation <br>
My words, only speak the truth <br>
Our hearts create this beauty <br>
No one will stand in my way <br>


Spring will soon arrive, and the sun will begin to shine <br>
Can you find my warmth, can you see my smile <br>
Where have we been, where are we going <br>
Your leading me in your shadow, guide me to you <br>
<br>

Shear off the doubts, look the other way <br>
Feelings for you are concrete, never wishing to stop <br>
Take my frustration, shadow it with trust <br>
I will follow your path, take me into your heart <br>
<br>

Do these words help my tears, dry my eyes <br>
Gently sweeping your face with kindness <br>
Know my heart, please trust my ways <br>
It's been a long road to find you, don't let me go! <br>
<br>

Sparkling in Gold... <br>
