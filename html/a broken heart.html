          <h2>A BROKEN HEART</h2>

          <P>
            
Each day passes there's an emptiness inside me <br>
You are in heaven and held by Gods love <br>
I try to find comfort in that <br>
But the ache inside is so deep, I miss you!  <br>
<br>
You and I shared so much for so long <br>
Yet now it seems like moments, an eye blink in time <br>
I love you Shara, oh God I miss you! <br>
<br>
Going on living without you so very hard <br>
I miss our sister time, I miss you! <br>
Rest well my sister, rest in peace <br>
I will join you soon, and together we will reunite! <br>
<br>
Sparkling in Gold, <br>
Sparkie
