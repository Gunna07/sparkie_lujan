    <h2>REMEMBERING WHEN</h2>
    <p>
    
My mind takes a trip back into the past <br>
Hoping to rekindle feelings that didn't last <br>
We shared a childhood, so many years ago <br>
Kicking our feet in the neighborhood pond with our toes <br>
<br>

Eating lollipops, and giggling hours away <br>
Promising one another, our bond would never stray <br>
How does time separate the dreams from the reality now <br>
Closing my eyes, remembering the smiles and your crooked eye brow <br>
<br>

Our jeans always had holes, and our hands were always dirty <br>
Taking our sling shots and firing at the twirling blue birdies <br>
Skipping rounded flat rocks over the pond in a race <br>
Trying to see if they would skips over the waves with grace <br>
<br>

Do you remember the bikes we both painted <br>
Mom got so angry, she yelled and yelled till she almost fainted <br>
Giggling right now as I remember these images <br>
Lying together on the grass during the football scrimmages <br>
<br>

The neighborhood girls, would gather behind a huge tree <br>
Watching us frolic and play, hoping we couldn't see <br>
All of them standing their pretty, with frills and envious eyes <br>
Only you and me knew they were looking, cause we were the spies <br>
<br>

Those were the days, my mind loves to remember <br>
Also the Christmas's we shared in the month of December <br>
Where are you now as the days slip away, oh buddy of mine <br>
I put away my boyish behavior but would love to share just one more time <br>
<br>

If you miss the days that we traveled together back then <br>
I suggest you close your eyes and see these images and pretend <br>
Us meeting again and having such a wonderful time on this day <br>
I am a woman now, wondering where my childhood buddy is at play <br>
<br>

Sparkling in Gold... <br>
