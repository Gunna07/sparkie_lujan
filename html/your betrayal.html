        <h2>YOUR BETRAYAL, HOW COULD YOU ?</h2>
        <P>
            
You called yourself my best friend <br>
But that's not what it felt like in the end <br>
I loved you as a friend and buddy <br>
How could you take our friendship and make it so muddy <br>
<br>

I told you things that I held in private <br>
Your betrayal is making our friendship now quiet <br>
You said thing to others, that we privately shared <br>
How could you gossip, I thought you cared <br>
<br>

What happen when you betrayed my trust <br>
I have to tell you how it feels, I must <br>
You killed what took years to build <br>
Now I stand without you in this friendship field <br>
<br>

It's tearing out the fibers of my heart you know <br>
Shame on you with this vicious gossip act you showed <br>
I wish and thought I could have trusted you more <br>
I hate now having to shut this friendship door <br>
<br>

Look at my heart, it's now in pieces <br>
You folded our love for one another...now it's showing creases <br>
You have sent me away in another direction of life <br>
All for your gossiping words ...it hurts like a  double edged knife <br>
<br>

The searing and tearing apart of what we had <br>
I hope you realize the damage to us is bad <br>
There is forgiveness deep in my heart you see <br>
I wish you didn't gossip and hurt the friend you had in me <br>
<br>

I say good bye with abundant tears in my eyes <br>
I hate that fact that our friendship now is dormant, all from lies <br>
Completely silenced are the words we use to share <br>
Dear Friend of mine, I thought you really cared. <br>
<br>

Sparkling in Gold... <br>
