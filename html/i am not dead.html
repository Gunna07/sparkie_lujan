<h2>I AM NOT DEAD IF YOU REMEMBER ME</h2>
<p>
    I am not dead, just not seen <br>
    Your eyes have no vision of me <br>
    Yet your mind reflects on my uniform <br>
    You are living in the peace I attained for you <br>
    <br>
    
    Remember Me <br>
    <br>
    
    I did this with honor, dignity, and pride <br>
    Your breath is only an extension of my gift to you <br>
    I am a fallen causality of a proclaimed war <br>
    But my life will never be over in your memory <br>
    <br>
    Remember Me <br> <br>


    I loved my family, and my country too <br>
Now I rest in peace for the colors of the red, white, and blue <br>
<br>
May our flag continue its flight in peace <br>
As I rest in the ground being remembered by you <br> 
<br>

Remember Me <br>
<br>

Sparkling in Gold, <br> 

Sparkie
