        <h2>SISTERS</h2>
        <p>
       
            Days together, lives shared, secrets hushed by love <br>
            Never knowing, how our paths will take hold <br>
            Only bonding with hearts, and souls <br>
            Clothes bought, shoes worn out, smiles forever present <br>
            <br>
            Strangers carry us from place to place, never seeing our faces <br>
            Past rearing, cold as it was, warmth is what we created <br>
            Smiles, and phone calls, and touches of words, tears flowing at will <br>
            Hearts that are meshed by bonds of emotions and secrets <br>
            <br>
            You protect me, as I protect you, for we are sisters <br>
            They say, our paths will walk differently now that we're adults <br>
            We have proven them wrong, you and I, <br>
            once again, this is done by love <br>
            <br>

            My hand is clasped in yours, and yours tightly in mine <br>
            Laughing, with crying, verbalizing, and reminiscing <br>
            Days turn into years, blinks of time, is all we share now <br>
            Our spirits alive, fulfilled with love <br>
            <br>
            I will continue to stand with you <br>
            As in health, struggling through sickness, and mourning of deaths <br>
            <br>
            Together we have sat through them all in sister bound love <br>
            Now once again we are heeding the call of sisters <br>
            With you my shadow is there <br>
            I will find a way, to gain the strength <br>
            to travel this road of life <br>
            <br>
            Don't leave me alone, I need your air to breath, my soul belongs to you <br>
            <br>
            How can this be, diseased in life, oh sister of mine <br>
            I love you so <br>
            We will do as in the past, walk in the same shadow and care <br>
            For we are one, bodies of two <br>
            bonded by blood and love <br>
            <br>
            My constant will of pounding down doors, we will find a way <br>
            to keep you here with me <br>
            If there is a will, and there is a way, I will walk the miles for you <br>
            Asking the questions, gaining the knowledge to save you <br> 
            I do this with love, with tears in my eyes, and a heart that's breaking <br>
            <br>
            Searching a cure as the nights pass till dawn <br>
            You are my sister, and I love you <br>
            With God as our guide <br>
            Prayers from our lips, we will survive <br>
            <br>
            Lift up the burden, wrap your arms around me <br>
            And hold on, while we ride wherever this journey takes us <br>
            We cannot hide for we have one another <br>
            I will hold you my sister, I will love you forever <br>
            <br>
            Never doubt this strength of mine my dear sister <br>
            Find the courage in our sister s bonded love to fight <br>
            <br>
            Always remember, we are one, life will carry us through <br>
            My warmth is abound, and my heart is pure <br>
            My eyes can see the light through the tears <br> 
            No rock will be left unturned, No strangers will separate us <br>
            <br>
            How blessed I am with you, our prayers will get us through <br>
            <br>
            Why??? <br>
            <br>
            Because we are sisters, bonded eternally by sister gifted love! <br>
